     <h1>What Is Angular?</h1>
         
     
     
     
        <p> <blockquote>Angular is an open-source web application development framework written in TypeScript which
            is used to build dynamic and interactive web applications and is maintained by Google. Its
            primary purpose is to develop single-page applications. As a framework, Angular has clear
            advantages while also providing a standard structure for developers to work with. It enables
            users to create reusable templates and components to design complex and large applications in a
         maintainable manner. Angular was developed by Google and was first released in 2010.</blockquote> </p>

     <section>
         
         <h2>History</h2>
          <p>Angular is a widely used open-source web development framework created by a team at Google led by Misko Hevery. It was first made available in 2010 under the name AngularJS, then in 2016 it underwent a substantial overhaul using TypeScript. Building complicated online apps is made simple by Angular's component-based architecture, two-way data binding, and dependency injection. Its modular structure enables developers to just use the functionality they actually need, interface with other libraries and frameworks, and make their own unique application components.</p>
         <p> Making development more effective and manageable, especially for large-scale online applications, is one of Angular's key advantages. Developers may create applications that are simpler to test, modify, and upgrade over time by utilizing a component-based design. Reactive programming using RxJS is embedded into Angular, making it simple to construct and handle asynchronous data streams. The framework has a sizable and vibrant developer community that actively participates in its development and offers help via forums, blogs, and other online tools.</p>
		 <p>In conclusion, Angular is a flexible and potent framework that has grown into a crucial tool for developers aiming to create cutting-edge and scalable online apps. It is a well-liked option for web development projects of all sizes and complexity levels because to its adaptable design and simplicity of usage.</p>

	    <h2> The developer </h2>
		<p> <strong><em>Misko Hevery and Adam Abrons worked closely together at Google and were both original members of the Angular team. Hevery, a highly accomplished software developer, received a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science and a Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Southern California.</p></strong></em>
		<p><strong><em>Abrons is also a software developer who contributed significantly to the early stages of AngularJS development. Together, Hevery and Abrons helped design Angular's architecture and develop key features, including the dependency injection system. While Abrons is no longer actively involved in the Angular project, their work on AngularJS was instrumental in its success and continues to have a lasting impact on the software development community.</strong></p></em>

	 <h1 class="h12">What groups, if any are responsible for managing it?</h1> 
	 <p>Angular is an open-source framework for building web applications.Angular is backed by Google and they have a team of developers to develope it.</p>
	 <p>Angular maintained by combination of the angular team at Google and the wider community of developers and contributors. Google’s Angular team is responsible for managing and updating the frameworks,including releasing new versions, adding new features and fixing bugs.</p>
	 <p>Core developers are responsible for maintaining the framework’s code documentation, and ecosystem. The Angular team consists of core developers and community developers who contribute to the project through code contributions, bug reports, and feature requests.</p>
     <p>At Google there are independent organizations and individuals who provide support, training and consulting services for angular development, in the addition to the angular team. These teams may provide additional tools, libraries and resources for working with Angular. But they are not fully responsible for managing the framework.</p>
	 <br>
	 <h1 class= "h12">Explain its growth or decline. Predict the future for the technology.</h1>
	 <p> Angular is a popular open-source front-end framework for building web applications. Since its initial release in 2010, Angular has experienced both growth and decline in popularity.</p>
	 <h2> Growth:</h2>
	   <p>Angular’s initial release in 2010 was met with enthusiasm from developers looking for a robust framework for building complex web applications.</p>
	   <p>Angular's popularity grew significantly in 2013 with the release of AngularJS, which offered a powerful set of tools for creating dynamic, single-page applications.</p>
	   <p>Angular's growth continued with the release of Angular 2 in 2016, which was a complete rewrite of the framework that introduced a more modern, component-based architecture.</p>
	   <p>Angular's popularity has been driven by its large community of developers, extensive documentation,and powerful tooling.</p>
	 <h2>Decline:</h2>
	   <p>Angular's transition from AngularJS to Angular 2 was a significant change, which made it difficult for developers to migrate their existing applications.</p>
	   <p>Some developers criticized Angular for being too complex and difficult to learn compared to other front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js.</p>
	   <p>The release of Angular 2 also led to a fragmentation of the Angular ecosystem, with some developers continuing to use AngularJS and others adopting Angular 2 or later versions.</p>
	   <p>Angular's decline in popularity was also driven by the emergence of new front-end frameworks like React and Vue.js, which offered simpler and more flexible approaches to building web applications.</p>
	 <h2>Future:</h2>
	   <p>Despite some decline in popularity, Angular remains a popular and widely-used front-end framework.</p>
	   <p>Angular has continued to evolve and improve over time, with the release of new versions like Angular 12 in 2021.The Angular community remains active and engaged, with ongoing development of new tools and libraries for building Angular applications.</p>
	   <p>While Angular faces competition from other front-end frameworks, it still has a strong following among developers who value its powerful features and tooling.</p>
	   <p>Overall, it's likely that Angular will continue to be a popular choice for building complex web applications in the future, although it may face ongoing competition from other frameworks.</p>
